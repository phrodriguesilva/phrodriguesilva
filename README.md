### Who I am

Hello, my name is Pedro Henrique Rodrigues da Silva, I am a Computer Science student at PUC. In the last few years I developed some projects in the area, and recently I made the decision to be a mobile developer. I use Flutter and the Dart language as my main language, and my goal is to learn more and participate in larger projects.
